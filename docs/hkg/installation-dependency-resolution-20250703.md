# Installation & Dependency Resolution Documentation

**Event UUID:** `de268720-c912-483c-bdcd-0e68da47f8d7`  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-03T05:27:43Z  
**Project:** SanctissiMissa (Hello Word) - Liturgical Application  

## Overview

This document captures the complete installation process and dependency resolution for the multi-platform React Native liturgical application, including the React version conflict resolution using legacy peer dependencies.

## Hybrid Knowledge Graph (hKG) Documentation

This installation event has been documented across all three orthogonal representations:

1. **Neo4j Graph Database**: `docs/hkg/neo4j/installation-20250703-de268720.cypher`
2. **Qdrant Vector Store**: `docs/hkg/qdrant/installation-semantics-20250703-de268720.json`
3. **PostgreSQL Raw Logs**: `docs/hkg/postgres/installation-raw-logs-20250703-de268720.sql`

## Installation Process

### Project Structure

The project follows a monorepo architecture with two distinct package.json files:

```
Hello-Word-J/
├── package.json              # Root web package (Vite + React)
└── HelloWord/
    └── package.json          # React Native mobile package
```

### Initial Installation Attempt

**Command:** `npm install`  
**Working Directory:** `/home/robin/CascadeProjects/Hello-Word-J`  
**Result:** FAILED with ERESOLVE error

#### Error Analysis

```
npm error code ERESOLVE
npm error ERESOLVE unable to resolve dependency tree
npm error While resolving: hello-word-j-root@1.0.0
npm error Found: react@18.3.1
npm error Could not resolve dependency:
npm error peer react@"^19.1.0" from react-native@0.80.1
```

**Root Cause:** React Native 0.80.1 requires React ^19.1.0, but the project was configured with React ^18.2.0.

### Successful Resolution

**Command:** `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`  
**Result:** SUCCESS with warnings

#### Resolution Details

- **Strategy:** Legacy peer dependencies flag
- **Packages Removed:** 3
- **Packages Audited:** 1,286
- **Vulnerabilities:** 5 moderate severity
- **Duration:** ~1 second

### React Native Package Installation

**Command:** `cd HelloWord && npm install`  
**Working Directory:** `/home/robin/CascadeProjects/Hello-Word-J/HelloWord`  
**Result:** SUCCESS with warnings

#### Installation Metrics

- **Packages Added:** 2
- **Packages Removed:** 4  
- **Packages Changed:** 36
- **Packages Audited:** 1,289
- **Duration:** ~3 seconds

#### Warnings Generated

```
npm warn ERESOLVE overriding peer dependency
npm warn Found: @types/react@19.1.8
npm warn Could not resolve dependency:
npm warn peerOptional @types/react@"^12.0.1" from @react-native/new-app-screen@0.73.0
```

## Technical Analysis

### Dependency Conflict Pattern

This is a common pattern in multi-platform React Native projects:

1. **Web Package (Root):** Uses React 18.x for Vite compatibility
2. **Mobile Package:** Requires React Native which expects React 19.x
3. **Shared Dependencies:** Create version conflicts in the dependency tree

### Architecture Implications

The successful resolution demonstrates the project's **multi-platform architecture**:

- **Web Platform:** Vite + React + TypeScript
- **Mobile Platform:** React Native + Metro + TypeScript
- **Shared Core:** Common services and types

### Resolution Strategy Assessment

**Chosen Strategy:** `--legacy-peer-deps`

**Pros:**
- Immediate resolution of dependency tree conflicts
- Allows development to continue
- Maintains separation of concerns between platforms

**Cons:**
- Potentially incompatible versions running in production
- Requires careful testing of cross-platform functionality
- May mask underlying architectural issues

**Risk Level:** Low to Medium
- Both React 18 and React 19 are stable
- Legacy peer deps is a standard npm resolution strategy
- Project architecture naturally separates platform concerns

## Monitoring & Follow-up

### Required Actions

1. **Compatibility Testing:** Verify React 18/19 compatibility in shared components
2. **Version Monitoring:** Track React Native roadmap for React 19 official support
3. **Security Audit:** Address 5 moderate severity vulnerabilities
4. **Dependency Updates:** Plan migration to aligned React versions

### Success Metrics

- ✅ Both root and HelloWord packages installed successfully
- ✅ No blocking errors preventing development
- ✅ Multi-platform architecture maintained
- ⚠️ 5 moderate vulnerabilities require attention

## Key Learnings

1. **Multi-platform Complexity:** Monorepo React Native projects commonly experience version conflicts
2. **Resolution Patterns:** Legacy peer deps is effective for complex dependency trees
3. **Architecture Wisdom:** Separate package.json files help isolate platform-specific conflicts
4. **Development Workflow:** Installation should be documented in hKG for future reference
