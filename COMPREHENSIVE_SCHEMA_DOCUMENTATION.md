# Comprehensive Ecclesiastical Latin Database Schema

## Overview
This database schema supports computational theology through morphological analysis of ecclesiastical Latin texts from Jerome's Vulgate through modern Vatican usage. It provides epistemological flexibility for multiple analytical approaches while maintaining theological precision.

## Architecture Philosophy

### Multi-Layered Design
The schema implements a **hierarchical linguistic architecture** that scales from liturgical texts to the complete Vulgate while supporting multiple analytical frameworks:

```
Epistemological Framework (How we analyze)
    ↓ contextualizes
Historical Period (When it was written)
    ↓ contains
Textual Corpus (What collection of texts)
    ↓ composed_of
Passage (Coherent textual unit)
    ↓ contains
Morphological Word (Inflected form in context)
    ↓ derived_from
Lemma (Dictionary form)
    ↓ composed_of
Morpheme (Semantic/grammatical units)
    ↓ encodes
Theological Concept (Doctrinal meaning)
```

## Core Tables

### 1. Epistemological Frameworks
**Purpose**: Support multiple analytical approaches simultaneously
```sql
epistemological_frameworks (
    id, name, description, analytical_lens, scope, methodology,
    theological_position, research_goals, version, created_date
)
```

**Supported Frameworks**:
- **Theological Archaeological**: Jerome's theological biases through computational analysis
- **Jerome Signature Analysis**: Specific focus on translation choices and theological encoding
- **Liturgical Functional**: Current pastoral and liturgical usage
- **Historical Linguistic**: Evolution across historical periods

### 2. Historical Periods
**Purpose**: Temporal stratification for historical linguistic analysis
```sql
historical_periods (
    id, name, start_year, end_year, characteristics, major_figures,
    theological_context, linguistic_features, predecessor_id, successor_id
)
```

**Periods**:
- **Patristic** (100-800): Jerome, Augustine, foundational theology
- **Carolingian** (800-1000): Alcuin, liturgical standardization
- **Scholastic** (1000-1500): Aquinas, technical theological vocabulary
- **Tridentine** (1500-1962): Council of Trent, fixed liturgical formulae
- **Modern** (1962-present): Vatican II, pastoral adaptation

### 3. Textual Corpora
**Purpose**: Organize different text collections with metadata
```sql
textual_corpora (
    id, name, corpus_type, period_id, framework_id, source_type,
    language_source, completeness_status, scholarly_consensus
)
```

**Types**: `vulgate`, `liturgical`, `patristic`, `modern`, `comparative`

### 4. Theological Concepts
**Purpose**: Map doctrinal concepts to linguistic patterns
```sql
theological_concepts (
    id, name, definition, doctrinal_status, historical_development,
    morphological_markers, semantic_field, patristic_development
)
```

**Semantic Fields**: `trinity`, `christology`, `ecclesiology`, `sacramental`, `eschatological`

### 5. Morphological Hierarchy

#### Morphemes
**Purpose**: Sub-word semantic units that encode theological meaning
```sql
morphemes (
    id, form, normalized_form, morpheme_type, semantic_value,
    theological_encoding, historical_evolution, productivity
)
```

**Types**: `root`, `prefix`, `suffix`, `ending`, `stem`

#### Lemmas
**Purpose**: Dictionary forms with theological significance tracking
```sql
lemmas (
    id, dictionary_form, part_of_speech, semantic_field, definition,
    theological_significance, jerome_usage, patristic_usage, modern_usage
)
```

#### Morphological Words
**Purpose**: Inflected forms in textual context with full grammatical analysis
```sql
morphological_words (
    id, passage_id, sequence, surface_form, lemma_id,
    morphological_analysis, case_marking, tense_aspect, mood, voice,
    theological_significance, jerome_preference
)
```

### 6. Passages
**Purpose**: Coherent textual units with theological weight
```sql
passages (
    id, corpus_id, reference, content_latin, content_translation,
    theological_weight, jerome_signature, translation_notes
)
```

## Analytical Capabilities

### Jerome Signature Analysis
**Detection of Jerome's theological biases through translation choices**:
- Morphological preferences revealing ascetic theology
- Anti-Arian precision in Christological language
- Hebrew scholarship influence on syntax
- Classical rhetorical sophistication

### Theological Archaeology
**Computational discovery of encoded doctrinal meaning**:
- Trinitarian relationships encoded in case grammar
- Incarnational theology in tense selections
- Sacramental concepts in morphological construction

### Historical Evolution Tracking
**Language change across ecclesiastical periods**:
- Semantic drift in theological terminology
- Morphological standardization processes
- Doctrinal development through linguistic analysis

### Cross-Tradition Comparisons
**Comparative analysis across linguistic traditions**:
- Latin vs Greek theological expressions
- Hebrew influence on Latin theological vocabulary
- Translation challenges and theological implications

## Relationship Tables

### Word-Morpheme Mapping
```sql
word_morphemes (word_id, morpheme_id, position, contribution)
```

### Passage-Concept Encoding
```sql
passage_theological_concepts (
    passage_id, concept_id, encoding_strength, encoding_method, confidence_level
)
```

### Translation Choice Analysis
```sql
translation_choices (
    word_id, chosen_form, alternative_forms, choice_rationale,
    theological_impact, jerome_signature_strength
)
```

### Morphological Pattern Recognition
```sql
morphological_patterns (
    pattern_name, grammatical_structure, theological_function, frequency
)

pattern_instances (
    pattern_id, passage_id, start_word_position, end_word_position
)
```

## Analytical Views

### Jerome Signature Analysis View
```sql
CREATE VIEW jerome_signature_analysis AS
SELECT 
    p.reference, p.content_latin,
    AVG(w.jerome_preference) as avg_jerome_signature,
    COUNT(tc.choice_rationale) as translation_choices_count
FROM passages p
JOIN morphological_words w ON p.id = w.passage_id
LEFT JOIN translation_choices tc ON w.id = tc.word_id
GROUP BY p.id;
```

### Theological Concept Frequency View
```sql
CREATE VIEW theological_concept_frequency AS
SELECT 
    tc.name, tc.semantic_field,
    COUNT(ptc.passage_id) as usage_frequency,
    AVG(ptc.encoding_strength) as avg_encoding_strength,
    hp.name as historical_period
FROM theological_concepts tc
JOIN passage_theological_concepts ptc ON tc.id = ptc.concept_id
JOIN passages p ON ptc.passage_id = p.id
JOIN textual_corpora corp ON p.corpus_id = corp.id
JOIN historical_periods hp ON corp.period_id = hp.id
GROUP BY tc.id, hp.id;
```
