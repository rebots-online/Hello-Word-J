# Coverage Results - 2025-07-02 17:54 UTC

Attempted to run `npm test --prefix HelloWord` with coverage enabled. The command failed because `jest` could not be found due to missing dependencies. See log excerpt below:

```
$(cat /tmp/test.log)
```

As the environment restricts package installation, coverage could not be generated.
