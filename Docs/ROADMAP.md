## Phase 3: Advanced Voice Features (v1.3.0+)
*Target: 3-6 months post-public release*

### üé§ On-Device Voice Transcription
*Seamless spiritual reflection without typing interruptions*

#### Technical Approach: Multi-Tier Implementation

**Tier 1: Native Device Recognition (v1.3.0)**
- **Library**: `@react-native-voice/voice`
- **Approach**: Leverage built-in iOS/Android speech engines
- **Benefits**: 
  - Minimal CPU overhead (hardware-optimized)
  - No additional model downloads
  - Immediate availability on most devices
  - Privacy-first (no cloud calls)
- **Limitations**: Platform-dependent accuracy, internet needed for some features

**Tier 2: Enhanced On-Device Models (v1.4.0)**
- **Primary Option**: NVIDIA Parakeet TDT 0.6B v2
  - 600M parameter model with 6.05% WER
  - Commercial CC-BY-4.0 license
  - Optimized for mobile inference
  - Supports punctuation, capitalization, timestamps
- **Alternative Options**:
  - Whisper.cpp mobile ports
  - TensorFlow Lite optimized models
  - Platform-specific optimizations

#### Implementation Strategy

**Phase 3a: Foundation (v1.3.0)**
```typescript
interface VoiceTranscriptionService {
  startRecording(): Promise<void>;
  stopRecording(): Promise<TranscriptionResult>;
  isSupported(): boolean;
  getAvailableEngines(): TranscriptionEngine[];
}

interface TranscriptionResult {
  text: string;
  confidence: number;
  timestamp: Date;
  liturgicalContext?: LiturgicalDay;
}
```

**Phase 3b: Advanced Models (v1.4.0)**
- Model deployment strategy for Parakeet TDT
- Offline model management
- Fallback to native engines
- Performance monitoring and optimization

#### User Experience Features
